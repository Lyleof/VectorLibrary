*  Description:
*      This class is to simulate a stopwatch for processes.  At the
*  beginning of the program, the stopwatch must be initiated.  Then,
*  use the startClock to start the stop watch and use the getTime to
*  get the amount of time elapsed since the clock started.
*
*  e.g.
*  TimerSystem timer;
*
*  timer.startClock();
*  cout << "Hello, World!\n";
*  cout << "Time elapsed:  " << timer.getTime() << endl;
*
*  Certification of Authenticity:
*     I certify that this assignment is entirely my own work.
